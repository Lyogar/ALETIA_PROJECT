# ALETIA_PROJECT

The objective of my project is to analyze the earnings generated by different movies over the past 20 years to determine which genre is the most profitable and if there is any determining factor for a movie's success, such as genre, production company, or release month. Only earnings reported at the local level (North America) in the year of release will be taken into account. Three databases containing various movie data were collected from the following sources and analyzed for better results.

The genre and production company data were taken from the website www.the-numbers.com.
My project is divided into three parts in its coding section. In the first part, I handle the data to calculate the average earnings for each movie that appears in all three data sets, along with other adjustments for further analysis. The second part involves exploratory data analysis for each year. The final part includes a brief inferential analysis where I attempt to determine if the genre or production company has any influence on earnings
